### Get Started (macOS)
1. After installing VSCode, cd to `~/Library/Application Support/Code/` and clone the repo here
2. Delete the 'User' folder in this directory, and rename this VSCode-Settings to 'User'
3. (Optional) Get your favorite font into your system (Google how to do this on your own) and add it to the "editor.fontFamily" values
4. Run VSCode and happy hacking!
